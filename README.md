# Intelligent Integrated Style Guide

This project is an implementation of an intelligent integrated style guide. 
A modern style guide has a number of features that distinguish it from a traditional style guide, such as:

* **discoverable** - the writer can discover style guide rules as s/he writes
* **enforceable** - the writer is notified automatically when rules are not followed
* **interactive** - the writer is assisted to fix the detected issues
* **dynamic** - the style guide evolves in time, writers being able to propose updates/changes

This project uses the following technologies:

* DITA
* XSLT
* Schematron
* Schematron Quick Fix
